You got me second guessing everything
You mess me up, you mess me up
Smoking away all the pain
I'm rolling up, I'm rolling up
I'm taking shots to drown these memories
I'm drowning now, I'm drowning now
I shoulda never gave you the key
To my soul, yeah

I wanna be your lover (lover)
Don't wanna be your friend (friend)
Wish we could be forever
But I know this ain't it
